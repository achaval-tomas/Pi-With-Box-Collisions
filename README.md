# Pi-With-Box-Collisions
Approximating digits of PI with box Collisions in C++ visualized using SDL2. 

This is one of my first Coding Projects in C++, so it's far from perfect.

The goal is to approximate N digits of Pi by calculating the amount of perfectly elastic collisions between a 1kg Box wiht a 100^(N-1)Kg box and a wall.

Real perfectly elastic collisions are calculated and it's optimized to perform faster with bigger masses. 

There's music that I thought fit well with the project but it can easily be removed by deleting all SDL_Mixer related code.
